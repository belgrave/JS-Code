		<div class="Column text-Center">There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all 		the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the 			current when it serves, or lose our ventures.<p>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
			I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.The evil that men do lives after them;The good is oft interred with their bones;So let it be with Caesar.</p> <p>The noble BrutusHath told you Caesar was ambitious:If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
			And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest— For Brutus is an honourable man;</p>So are they all, all honourable men—Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
			But Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man.<p>He hath brought many captives home to Rome
			Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept: 
			Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honourable man.You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown,Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</p>
			<p>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And, sure, he is an honourable man.I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause:What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
			O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,And I must pause till it come back to me.</p>
